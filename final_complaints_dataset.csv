S-101,"I have concerns about dogs in the hall. While I understand that most of them remain quiet and well-behaved, there have been instances when they started barking among themselves or towards hall residents, and this becomes really irritating when you are trying to sleep at night and they randomly start barking and/or fighting among themselves, right before your room. Additionally, many of us are uncomfortable with dogs sleeping and leaving garbage scattered in our wings or blocks. Specifically, I'm referring to S Block, where I reside. However, it seems that this issue is not limited to my block but extends to all floors and blocks in the hall. So, I think measures should be taken. It would be greatly appreciated if they could be relocated outside the main gate or at least away from the reception area.",Other,Medium,S Block ,"Dogs bark at night and create disturbance. They enter blocks, leave garbage, and make residents uncomfortable. This happens across the hall, especially in S block. Request relocation away from reception."
